            <h2>Understanding Social Engineering</h2>
            <p>Most cyber criminals and hackers are master of human manipulation
                and deception before they are experts in hacking and technology, because if
                someone gives you their own password, it's much easier than trying to hack it. This is the idea of social engineering. So, let's see what social
                engineering is. And what are the common techniques? And how do we prevent
                ourselves from its attacks? <br />
                <br />
                In general, protection and security means who you trust and
                what you trust. It is important to know when you trust someone and how you know
                that the person is really the person they claim to be. The same is true for
                social networks and websites. When do you trust a website that is real, and you
                can really share your information with them?<br />
                <div class="img-container"><img src="images/image1.png" alt="Social Engineering"></div>
                
            </p>
            <p><strong>Social engineering</strong> is a set of techniques to influence and
                deceive human beings to give you their important and confidential information by
                their own hands. This means that unlike other cyber-attacks that focus on vulnerabilities
                of the system, network and devices, social engineering targets human
                weaknesses, so it is often called human hacking.<br />
                <br />
                The cyber criminals who use social engineering are called
                social engineers whose aim is to obtain private, important, and confidential
                information, whether to steal or manipulate or corrupt them, and even to delete
                them.<br />
                <br />
                Like most types of manipulation and deception, social
                engineering is based on trust, a false trust. After that, persuasion comes, we
                generally have four stages in each social engineering attack:<br />
            
            <div class="img-container">
                <img src="images/image2.png" alt="Social Engineering Concept">
            </div>
            <br />
<strong>1. Preparation</strong>: The social engineer collects information
about the victims, for example where he/she can access them, such as social
networks, e-mails, SMSs, etc...<br /><br>
<strong>2. Infiltration and personalization</strong>: The social engineer
approaches the victims, presenting themselves as a trusted and legal person and
to prove that they use the information they have already collected on the
target.<br><br>
<strong>3. Exploitation</strong>: The social engineer uses his/her ability to
persuade the victim to ask for information such as passwords, payment methods, contact
information, and anything else that is useful for them.<br /><br>
<strong>4. Disengagement</strong>: The social engineer breaks communication with
the target after the data is obtained and the data is accessed.<br><br>
According to the type of attack, each of these steps can
take from hours to months.<br>

            <h2>Common Social Engineering Tactics</h2>
            <p>
                Social engineering can occur everywhere, whether online or
                offline, unlike common cyber-attacks that occur secretly and without notice,
                attacks by social engineers occur directly before your eyes.<br />
                <div class="img-container">
                    <img src="images/image3.png" alt="">
                </div><br>
                <strong>1. A friend sends you a strange message</strong>: Social engineers
                can present themselves as trusted people in your life as your friends, your
                manager, your colleagues, and even your bank organization. they will send you a message on their behalf containing harmful links.<br><br>
                <strong>2. Working on the emotional side</strong>: the less our feelings are
                under our control the more our defense will be weaker in front of social engineering,
                feelings such as fear, excitement, curiosity, anger, guilt, sadness will
                be the targets of social engineers. So, think twice before your online interactions.<br><br>
                <strong>3. The request is urgent</strong>: Social engineers don't want you to
                think about their techniques twice, so most attacks contain a kind of urgent
                and haste as it asks you to enter your information directly or asks you to download
                security program because your device contains viruses.<br><br>
                <strong>4. The offer feels too good to be true</strong>: Have you ever
                received a message that you haven't asked for? Even great news that you've won a lottery
                or got a license of a service for free.<br><br>
                <strong>5. You will receive help and services that you didn&rsquo;t ask
                for</strong>: Social engineers may contact you as a representative of a company that
                solves a problem that you have, for example, you have a technical issue and they
                contact you as a support team, so you will give them direct access to edit
                your system.<br><br>
                <strong>6. The sender can&rsquo;t prove their identity</strong>: For example, when
                you suspect someone and ask him to prove his/her identity by video call, he/she
                refuses.<br><br>
                <br><br>
                Like most cyber-attacks, social engineering has many forms
and techniques that continuously evolving, these are some of its common types:<br><br>
                    <div class="img-container">
                        <img src="images/image4.png" alt="">
                    </div>
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Scareware: </strong> As it appears from its name, Scareware is a
                    type of malware created to scare you and do something. It often comes to you in
                    the form of emails and popups and asks you to do something directly, for
                    example, "downloading a program to clean up harmful viruses and
                    files", which is the virus itself.</li>
                <li><strong>Phishing: </strong>Is a common way to get information and data
                    from an unaware target, generally the social engineer sends a message to their
                    target as an organization or someone else and asking for an action from them,
                    such as verifying their email or downloading a specific program. It's worth
                    mentioning that phishing has different forms and types.</li>
                <li><strong>Spoofing: </strong>Also known as cache poisoning, occurs when the browser is manipulated, and users are directed to a harmful
                    website. In 2018, $17 million in bitcoin was stolen from users of the
                    MyEtherWallet website.</li>
                <li><strong>Baiting: </strong>This type often occurs on social medias when
                    someone asks you to download a video or piece of music that is secretly linked
                    to the virus. Or the engineer may leave a USB in a public place that loaded
                    with viruses and anyone who plug it to his device immediately the virus will be
                    transferred to his device.</li>
                <li><strong>Pretexting: </strong>The social engineer himself creates a story
                    that he knows it will capture of his target&rsquo;s attention, Once the story hooks
                    the person, the engineer tries to deceive him and get his confidential data.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>How to Recognize and Avoid Social Engineering</h2>
            <div class="warning">
                <strong>Caution:</strong> Be skeptical of unexpected requests for information or access.
            </div>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Verify Identities:</strong> Always confirm the identity of anyone requesting sensitive information, especially if the request is unexpected.</li>
                <li><strong>Be Wary of Urgent Requests:</strong> Social engineers often create a sense of urgency to bypass critical thinking.</li>
                <li><strong>Don't Share Sensitive Information Easily:</strong> Be cautious about what information you share online and offline.</li>
                <li><strong>Think Before You Click:</strong> Be wary of unfamiliar links and attachments.</li>
                <li><strong>Question Authority:</strong> Don't be afraid to question requests, even if they appear to come from a superior.</li>
                <li><strong>Secure Physical Spaces:</strong> Be mindful of who is around you when entering sensitive information or accessing secure areas.</li>
                <li><strong>Trust Your Gut:</strong> If something feels off, it probably is.</li>
