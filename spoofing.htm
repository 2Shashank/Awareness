            <h2>What is Spoofing?</h2>
            <p>In cyber security, spoofing is a tactic where perpetrators <strong>hide their identity or impersonate others.</strong> This deception allows cybercriminals to conduct detrimental acts like unauthorized wire transfers, circumventing security, breaking into company systems, or misappropriating classified data, typically by impersonating trusted figures to manipulate their victims. </p>
            <p>Spoofing, phishing, and social engineering share common ground. Specifically, cybercriminals use spoofing techniques in phishing emails to hide the sender’s identity and emotionally manipulate their victims. The end goal was to extract victims’ information for more targeted spear-phishing attacks while keeping their sinister intent under wraps.</p>
            <p>When spoofing, cybercriminals use a <strong>wide range of techniques and means</strong> to pose as someone else, including e-mail addresses, telephone numbers, IP addresses, GPS, URLs, and text messages. We’ll talk more about spoofing types later, but first, let’s look at what they have in common and the approach cybercriminals usually take.</p>

            <h2>Difference between Spoofing and Phishing</h2>
            <p>The line between spoofing and phishing is fluid, especially as <strong>many phishing attacks involve spoofing, but not all spoofing attacks are phishing.</strong> While spoofing refers to a type of deception, phishing is a specific attack tactic with the intent of causing harm.</p>

            <p>The term “spoofing”, at its core, merely refers to the <strong>provision of false information.</strong> Attackers use different techniques to make their victims believe that the attackers are someone else so that they can take advantage of their victims’ trust.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, phishing is a <strong>specific cyberattack type</strong> where cybercriminals try to steal access credentials, bank information, or other sensitive data, often via email.</p>

            <h2>Types of Spoofing</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Email Spoofing:</strong> Sending emails with forged sender addresses.</li>
                <li><strong>Caller ID Spoofing:</strong> Displaying a false phone number.</li>
                <li><strong>Website Spoofing:</strong> Creating fake websites that mimic legitimate ones.</li>
                <li><strong>IP Address Spoofing:</strong> Masking the origin of network traffic.</li>
                <li><strong>ARP Spoofing:</strong> Associating the attacker's MAC address with another device's IP address.</li>

            <h2>Protecting Yourself from Spoofing</h2>
            <div class="info">
                <strong>Information:</strong> Be cautious of unexpected communications and verify the source whenever possible.
            </div>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Verify Email Headers:</strong> Check the full email headers to identify potential spoofing.</li>
                <li><strong>Be Skeptical of Unknown Callers:</strong> Don't provide personal information to unsolicited callers.</li>
                <li><strong>Examine Website URLs:</strong> Look for subtle differences in website addresses.</li>
                <li><strong>Use Network Security Tools:</strong> Firewalls and intrusion detection systems can help identify IP spoofing.</li>
                <li><strong>Implement Email Authentication:</strong> Technologies like SPF, DKIM, and DMARC can help prevent email spoofing.</li>
            </ul>
